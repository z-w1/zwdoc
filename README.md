the idea is to create a text editor that can also use pictures. This could be useful if you don't like using print-based formats like word documents, openDocumentText, or pdf and still want images. this could be used to load images within sample code, for instance.

you must have python and pillow installed to make this code function. you can get python here: https://www.python.org/ to install pillow, at python setup there is an option to add python to the path. Check this option. Then enter this command to the terminal:

pip install Pillow

Currently it can:

    open/save text files
    have multiple tabs
    put pictures in files
    basic text functions like undo, redo, select
    find and replace text
    "export" option. It places images in a folder for sharing your file
    settings file, including color, spacing, and others
    automatic image resizing

planned features not implemented:

    undo deletion/insertion of image
    better image path detection
    spellcheck
    a different icon
